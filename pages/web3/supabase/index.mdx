# Supabase Reference App

In this topic, we are going to create a no-frills reference app that uses most of the core Supabase Functionalities but does not come with extra bundles so you can easily use this as a reference app whenever you need to look up things in future projects.

# Create a Supabase project

If you have not done already, go ahead and create a Supabase project. Under `project settings` > `api`, you will find project URL and API Keys sections. Take a copy of the URL and the key labeled `anon` for the next section.

# Create a Codesandbox project

Go to [codesandox.io](http://codesandox.io) and create new a “SANDBOX” (not DEVBOX) and choose “React” as your template.

# Install Supabase library

Find the “dependencies” section in the bottom left corner. Type in `@supabase/supabase-js` and make sure the version is `2.X.X`. (If not, lower the version to 2)

# Connect your app to your Supabase project

Supabase hosts millions of projects. We need to configure our app so that it connects to our Supabase project. We do this by using the keys we stashed earlier
