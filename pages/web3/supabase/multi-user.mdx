## Adding Multi-User Support

To support multiple users, we'll ensure that:

1. You can only see items that belong to you.
2. You can only edit items that belong to you.

> Please note that while this exercise improves security, it leaves for a room for further enhancement.

### Update the Item Table

First, we'll add a new column to the item table to associate each todo list item with a user.

```sql
ALTER TABLE item
ADD COLUMN user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

Run the above query in your SQL editor. If your item table isn't empty, you may encounter an error because existing records will have `user_id` as NULL. To resolve this, you can delete the items and run the query again:

```sql
TRUNCATE item;
```

> `TRUNCATE item` is equivalent to `DELETE FROM item` but faster.

### Adding user_id When Creating an Item

Next, we'll ensure that the `user_id` is added when creating a new item.

```jsx {2,6}
async function insert() {
  let user = (await supabase.auth.getUser()).data.user;
  const entry = {
    name,
    stars,
    user_id: user.id,
  };

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from("item")
    .insert(randomEntry)
    .select();
  setItems([...items, ...data]);
  console.log(data);
}
```

We retrieve the user's ID using `supabase.auth.getUser()`. Alternatively, you can extract it from the `session` state variable created earlier. Ensure that this ID is passed when calling the `insert()` function.

### Loading Items

When loading items, we'll add a condition to only fetch items that match the user's ID.

```jsx {2,6}
async function read() {
  let user = (await supabase.auth.getUser()).data.user;
  let { data: items, error } = await supabase
    .from("item")
    .select("*")
    .eq("user_id", user.id);
  setItems(items);
}
```

This adjustment ensures that you only retrieve items associated with the currently logged-in user.
